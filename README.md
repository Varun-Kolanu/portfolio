3. Run `npm i`
4. You can view the site on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Tech Stack Used:
Html, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, React JS.

## Notable feautures of the website:

### Codewise:
1. Hovering state of navbar.
2. Indication of the Section where you are present by color of navbar elements (By window.positionOffsetY).
3. Change of Contact Me button's position on scrolling (Manipulating height, width, text size on scrolling).
4. Smooth Scrolling (by react-scroll).
5. Scrolling animation - elements appear as animation as you scroll (By Intersection Observer).
6. Github, Codeforces, Codechef account links in About Me section.
7. Linking Website and Github repos to buttons in My Projects section.
8. I-frame elements to show projects in My projects section.
9. Form element to contact with clients.
10. Hover states of buttons.
11. Can send Gmail and Whatsapp to me directly by clicking on the Send Mail, Send Messages respectively.
12. Linked In, Facebook, Instagram profiles in Contact Section.
13. Can jump into a section by clicking on navigation menu.
14. Used react-icons
15. Gradients done by tailwind css.
16. Used Shadows by tailwind css.
17. Responsive
18. In small screens, navbar replaced with hamburger, dropdown.
19. When you click on hamburger, you can see it animating to a cross. 

### Designing wise:
1. Used 60-30-10 rule. Major portion is Bluish shades, Medium portion for white, Minimal portion for Orange, Pink.
2. Heirarchy maintained. Firstly, Image attracts a person then "Myself Varun", "Contact Me" are observed, then small description, navigation menu is seen.
3. Width of the main content is limited to 1000px(in desktop) so that one can read comfortably without moving the head much.
4.  Blue Color is Major since Blue denotes Security, trust, responsibility which are expected in a developer by clients.
    White: New beginnings, purity
    Orange: Optimistic, Sociable, Cheerful.
    Pink: Nurturing hope.
5. Font: Mono
